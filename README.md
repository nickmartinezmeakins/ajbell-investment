This uses Nextjs, Tailwind Storybook and Jest (although it's currently broken - there is a Babel config issue with it that I need more time to investigate)

## Getting Started

Please use nvm or similar to use > node 18 and then run nmp i. Once that is done you can then run npm run build and then npm run start. 

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
